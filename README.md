# AI-Powered Sign Language Recognition System

## üìñ Overview
This project is an **AI-powered sign language recognition system** designed to enhance accessibility and communication for individuals with hearing or speech impairments.  
By combining **computer vision** and **deep learning**, the system captures hand gestures through a webcam and translates them into text in real time.  

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how AI can be applied to build inclusive solutions that bridge communication gaps.
